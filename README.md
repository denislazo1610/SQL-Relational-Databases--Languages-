# Overview

In here, I am trying to learn how to create sql commands using python. Also, I wanted to learn more about how Duolingo or Babble works with 
databases.

In the first part, the user will be asked to create a databses file. Then, the user will have options such as creating a table, modifying a table, 
deleting a table, or query some entities and exit from the programm. 

Personally, I wanted to create a web site with users. This programm gave me a really good point of view about collecting informations from the
users.
